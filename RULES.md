# Rules and Defaults for Nested Programs

## Rules

- The goal **is** to make a nested program that covers as much languages as possible.

- The score **is** calculated as:

        source length / languages covered

- Lowest score **wins**.

## Defaults

- The code length **can only** be up to 64 bytes.
