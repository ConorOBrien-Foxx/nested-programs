# Task 1 - Nest, nest, nest, ..., STOP!

## Rules

- The goal **is** to make a nested program that covers as much languages as possible.

- The score **is** calculated as:

        source length / languages covered

- The code length **can only** be up to 64 bytes.

## Task

- The deepest program **must** print `STOP!`, with or without a trailing new line.

## Instead of conclusion

Lowest score **wins**. Good Luck!
